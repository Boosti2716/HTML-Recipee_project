    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Enchilada sauce</b></li>
        <li><b>Tortillas</b> (corn or flour) <b>(Dont use flour tortillas!)</b></li>
        <li><b>Filling</b>(cooked meat, beans, cheese, and seasonings)</li>
        <li><b>Shredded cheese</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Preheat</b> the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Prepare the filling.</b> You can use store-bought enchilada filling or make your own. 
            If making your own, simply combine cooked meat, beans, cheese, and your desired seasonings.</li>
            <br>
        <li><b>Warm the tortillas.</b> If using corn tortillas, wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds. If using 
            flour tortillas, brush them with a little bit of oil and heat them in a skillet over medium heat for a few seconds on each 
            side.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Assemble the enchiladas.</b> Spread a layer of enchilada sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Then, fill each tortilla with
            the desired amount of filling and roll it up. Place the rolled enchiladas seam-side down in the baking dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Top with sauce and cheese.</b> Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the enchiladas, then top with shredded cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Bake for 20-25 minutes, </b>or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Enjoy!</b> Serve the enchiladas with your favorite toppings, such as sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.</li>
