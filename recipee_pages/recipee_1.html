        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1Kg flour</b></li>
            <li><b>1 tbspoon fine salt</b></li>
            <li><b>2 1/2 cups warm water</b></li>
            <li><b>2 big spoons olive oil</b></li>
            <li><b>30g fresh yeast</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the dough.</b> You can use store-bought dough or make your own. 
                If making your own, simply combine flour, yeast, water, salt, 
                and olive oil in a bowl and knead until smooth. Cover 
                the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.</li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Prepare the sauce.</b> Heat some tomato sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. 
                Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to taste.</li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Roll out the dough.</b> Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
                Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the dough into a 12-inch circle.</li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Add the toppings.</b> Spread the sauce evenly over the dough, then top with your desired toppings.
                Some popular toppings include mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms,
                onions, and peppers.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Bake the pizza.</b> Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown 
                    and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><b>Enjoy!</b> Cut the pizza into slices and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
